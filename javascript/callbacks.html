      <h1>Callbacks</h1>
      <p>
        Simply a function that is
        <strong>passed as an argument to another function</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The outer function will eventually call (or "invoke") the callback
        function after it completes its own task.
      </p>
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When you pass a function as an argument, you're passing a reference to
          that function in memory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inside the outer function, you can call the callback function using
          the reference that was passed in. The callback doesn't get executed
          immediately; it gets invoked when the outer function is ready.
        </li>
        <li>
          Because the callback is passed by reference, the outer function can
          invoke the same instance of the function that was passed in, not a
          copy. This means any changes (like closures or variable access) within
          the callback will use the same memory context as the original
          function.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <pre>
        function outerFunction(callback) {
          console.log("Outer function started!");
          callback();
          console.log("Outer function finished!");
        }

        function innerFunction() {
          console.log("Inside the callback function!");
        }

        outerFunction(innerFunction);
      </pre>
      <h3>Asynchronous Programming</h3>
      <p>
        Callbacks are essential in asynchronous programming (setTimeout, event
        listeners, promises) because it allows the program to continue executing
        without freezing the rest of the program. While the JavaScript runtime
        is waiting for the asynchronous task to complete, it can continue
        executing other code, and once the task finishes, the callback is
        invoked to handle the result.
      </p>
      <h3>Callback Hell</h3>
      <p>
        Before ES6, we had nested callbacks. When handling multiple asynchronous
        operations, callbacks were often nested inside other callbacks, leading
        to deeply indented code that's hard to read and maintain. This became
        known as callback hell.
      </p>
      <p>ES6 introduced Promises and async/await</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Promises allow you to chain asynchronous operations
          <pre>
            fetchData()
              .then(result => doSomethingElse(result))
              .then(newResult => doAnotherThing(newResult))
              .then(finalResult => console.log(finalResult))
              .catch(error => console.error(error));
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          async/await further simplified asynchronous code
          <pre>
            async function processData() {
              try {
                let result = await fetchData();
                let newResult = await doSomethingElse(result);
                let finalResult = await doYetAnotherThing(newResult);
                console.log(finalResult);
              } catch (err) {
                console.error(err);
              }
            }
            processData();
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Callbacks and Closures</h2>
      <p>
        Because functions are being passed as arguments to another function,
        they will retain access to the variables in it's lexical scope.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, when a callback is passed to an asynchronous function like
        setTimeout or fetch(), it still has access to any variables in the scope
        where it was created, allowing you to work with those variables even
        after the asynchronous operation completes.
      </p>
      <h2>Event-driven Programming</h2>
      <p>
        In event-driven programming, the flow of execution is determined by
        events—like user actions, network responses, or timers—that trigger
        specific functions. The program doesn’t execute sequentially; instead,
        it responds to these events as they occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        To not freeze or block the rest of the program, using callbacks are key
        to handling these operations.
      </p>
