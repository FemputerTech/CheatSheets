      <h1>References and Values</h1>
      <h2>Primitive Data Types (Values)</h2>
      <p>Such as: string, number, boolean, etc.</p>
      <p>
        These hold their actual value. When you assign a primitive value to a
        variable or pass it to a function, a <strong>copy</strong> of that value
        is created
      </p>
      <h3>Key characteristics:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pass-by-value:</strong> When you assign a primitive to a
          variable, or pass it to a function, you get a copy of the value.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Immutability:</strong> You can't modify the original primitive
          value directly once it's been set. However, you can assign a new value
          to the variable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reassigning:</strong> Reassigning a primitive means setting it
          to a new value.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <pre>
        let a = 10;
        let b = a; // Copy of the value, not a reference

        b = 20; // Reassigning b won't affect a
        console.log(a); // 10
        console.log(b); // 20
      </pre>
      <h2>Objects and Arrays (References)</h2>
      <p>
        Objects (including arrays and functions) in JavaScript are reference
        types. When you assign an object to a variable or pass it to a function,
        you're not copying the actual object. Instead, you're copying the
        reference (or memory address) where the object is stored.
      </p>
      <h3>Key characteristics:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pass-by-refernce:</strong> When you assign an object to a
          variable, or pass it to a function, you are passing the reference to
          the original object, not a copy of the object.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mutability:</strong> Objects can be modified. If you change a
          property of an object or an array, those changes affect all references
          to the object.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reassigning:</strong> Reassigning a reference means pointing
          it to a different memory location.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <pre>
        let obj1 = { name: 'Alice' };
        let obj2 = obj1; // obj2 is a reference to the same object as obj1

        obj2.name = 'Bob'; // Modifying obj2 also affects obj1
        console.log(obj1.name); // Bob
        console.log(obj2.name); // Bob
      </pre>
